# üé¨ Movie Night Crisis - AI-Powered Interactive Story

An interactive web application that puts you in a social crisis: you've been mistaken for a movie expert and need to convincingly discuss films you've never seen! Powered by a custom-trained GPT model that generates creative movie plot summaries to save your reputation.

## üéØ What This Project Does

You're at a friend's place after movie night. As you're leaving, they mention that someone told them you're a huge movie buff with amazing taste. Problem: you barely watch movies!

The app simulates this awkward conversation where you must:

1. **Recommend movies** on the spot
2. **Explain their plots** convincingly
3. **Save face** using AI-generated plot summaries

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

- **Data**: Trained on the [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) (~42k movie plots, 360MB), licensed under CC BY-SA  
- **Model**: Custom **nanoGPT** (8 layers, 8 heads, 256 embedding size, ~19M parameters)  
- **Training**: ~2 hours on GPU, loss converged to ~1.8, final checkpoint ~230MB  
- **Integration**: Backend serves AI completions; React frontend simulates the social scenario with dialogue, pacing, and effects  

üëâ End result: a custom AI movie buff that invents convincing plots on demand.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Enter Names**: Your name and your movie-loving friend's name
2. **Get Caught**: The friend asks you to recommend movies
3. **Think Fast**: Enter any movie title when prompted
4. **Watch Magic**: AI generates a convincing plot summary
5. **Survive**: Complete 3 movie recommendations to win!

## ü§ñ AI Model Training

The GPT model was trained specifically on movie and TV show plot data:

```bash
# Prepare training data
cd ./backend/
python python train.py config/train_shows.py --device={cpu, cuda, mps, etc} --compile=False --eval_iters=20 --log_interval=1 --block_size=128 --batch_size=32 --n_layer=8 --n_head=8 --n_embd=256 --max_iters=2000 --lr_decay_iters=2000 --dropout=0.0

# Train the model (took ~2 hours on GPU)
cd ../../backend
python train.py config/train_shows.py

# Monitor training
# Loss: Started at ~4.2, converged to ~1.8
# Model size: 19.17M parameters
# Final checkpoint: 230MB
```

## üöÄ What's Next
